Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor 
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor 
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
* Following the RStudio convention, a .99 is appended after the patch
  number to indicate the development version on Github.  Any version
  Coming from Github will now use the .99 extension, which will never
  appear in a version number for the package on CRAN. 


v0.1.0
------

* Initial Release
